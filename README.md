# Using Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis Methods in the Diagnostics of Heart Disease

This study aims to explore the possibilities of statistical analysis and machine learning methods in the diagnosis of heart disease. Within the study, a dataset on almost three hundred patients (laboratory measurements, anamnesis, diagnosis) was analyzed and a functional relationship between these data and the diagnosis was found.<br>
